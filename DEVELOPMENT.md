## Future
I started this as a fun project to improve my knowledge of Shell scripting. I liked it and I have a lots of ideas of how I can improve it, make it more useful and friendly.
But I will do that in a new Python code base. It wil be more sane, easier to add new features, easier to debug and mantain, support a larger share of operational systems.
