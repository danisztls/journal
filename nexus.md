# What is Nexus?
Nexus is a document management system that is heavily integrated with the system tools and interface and developed in a bottom-up minimalistic approach.

# What is an DMS?
Document management systems have the goal to seamless integrate three core tasks: archive, search and provide. Archive means that the system should store and version the documents. Search means that users have a way to discover the right documents through context. And provide means that users can view/edit documents and share them with collaborators.

# How it works?
The core of the system is git and markdown Gnome and vscode is the most complete interface combo but any other text editor, like vim or emacs, or desktop environment can be effectively used.
