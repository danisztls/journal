**Tracker** is a spinoff of Journal aimed at helping teams or individuals manage their software development tasks.

Most project management solutions, from an understandable but not adequate reason, overengineer these functions into big and complex frontend/backend systems. While those have a long list of functionalities and pretty interfaces they are innefectual and a pain in the ass to use.
