# Syntax and HL Test

This is a syntax matching and highlighting test.

**This should get highlighted:**

TODO: Do something. +later +asap +done #test @lbcnz =20-07-12 >20-07-12 !20-07-12 

**While this shouldn't:**

In the middle of a sentence a TODO isn't a todo. Commitment + Time = Achievements! Consistency > short-term results. Some things are done, some I will do later and some I must do asap. # in the start of a line and followed by a space is a header. Email me at user@server.com.
