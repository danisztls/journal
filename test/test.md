# Test Note

This is a test note for
- todo parsing.
- syntax matching.
- highlighting test.

**This should get highlighted:**

TODO: Do what is important +asap #einsenhower
TODO: Leave the urgent trivial to +later #priority
TODO: And then you will get things +done #matrix
TODO: Remember it.

**While this shouldn't:**

In the middle of a sentence a TODO isn't a todo. Commitment + Time = Achievements! Consistency > short-term results. Some things are done, some I will do later and some I must do asap. # in the start of a line and followed by a space is a header. Email me at user@server.com.
